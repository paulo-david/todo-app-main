## My process

### Built with

- React Components
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For less runtime errors and more reusability
- [redux/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - For managing states 
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [vercel](https://vercel.com/) - For deploying the app


### What I learned

How to use redux/toolkit for controlling an variable state, why an CORB error appeared when trying to get an font.


### Continued development

Using styled-components and redux/toolkit to manage the dark and light mode has a lot of repetition. Create an API to talk with the website so that the tasks are saved in the user profile.
